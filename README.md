# Project 1 :books:

In project one we create a webapplication via which users can register to gain access to a database of 5000 books. They can search for a book to get more detailed info about it, such as the isbn number or reviews and ratings left by other users. Furthermore ratings left on another webapplication called GoodReads are included in the book page as well.
